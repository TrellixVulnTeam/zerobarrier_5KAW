# This is an example .muffin file that grabs some of the files in the asset directory and zips
# them up.

# A .muffin file consists of a json array filled with commands that can be executed by muffinman.
# Each command is a series of jobs that are executed in the order they are specified.

# As jobs execute, they may add or remove files from the global file store. In this way the jobs
# can generate new content, replace content, package content, and filter content as they execute.

# For example, the activate_files job will add all files (and subdirectory files) that match
# the give pattern to the ActiveFiles list. Then, the zip job will run, adding all the files that
# are in the ActiveFiles to an archive.
