Zero Barrier Readme
-------------------

* What is Zero Barrier?
  ---------------------
  Zero Barrier consists of a loose collection of modules that implement 
  all kinds of useful functionality from memory managment, to profiling, 
  to networking.
  
  It's designed in such a way that you can cherry pick the modules you'd
  like to integrate into an existing framework. You can also make use of
  the Zero Barrier framework if you're starting a game from scratch.
  
* Availability
  ------------
  Zero Barrier is freely available for both academic and commercial purposes.
  See LICENSE for details.

* Configuration
  -------------
  There are a number of compile time configuration options that can be specified.
  See CONFIG for details.
  
* Organization
  ------------
  The Zero Barrier codebase is organized in such a way that you can integrate
  the pieces you're interested in and ignore the ones you're not.
  
  If you're planning on using zb_framework then everything is taken care of
  for you. You just need to the .h and .cc framework files in your
  project and they'll pull in everything you need. See the zb_framework folder
  for details on how to use it.
  
  Otherwise, you will need to include zbd.h and zbd.c and likely zb_stl.h in your project. After
  that it's up to you to include the other modules you're interested in.
  
  To include a module in your project you just need to include the appropriate
  zb_*.h and zb_*.cc files. These files will pull in the remaining files they
  need from internal directories.
  
  For example, if you're interested in using zb_math, you would simply need to
  build zbd.h, zbd.c, zb_math.h, and zb_math.cc. To integrate zb_input after this
  you'd just need to add zb_input.h and zb_input.cc.
  
  Files in the internal directories do not include their own dependencies, so
  attempting to include these files directly will likely result in build errors.
